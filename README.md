# Spectral-Methods-for-Pde
Some spectral method codes from my Applicable Math Method Course in TIFR CAM
Assignment 5 contain some spectral method codes for ODE and comparison of spectral method and finite difference methods.
Assignment 6 contains use spectral method along with RK04 time steppoing to solve pdes.
